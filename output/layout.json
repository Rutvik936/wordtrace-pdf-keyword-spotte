The IASB provides a helpful, ut non-exhaustive list of possible impacts of climate issues n financial statements (eg, inventory valuation, fair value leasurement, impairment test etc.).

In March 2023, and in response to concerns expressed by stakeholders that information about the effect of climate- related risks is sometimes insufficient or appears to be inconsistent with information provided outside the financia statements, the IASB added to its work plan a project to explore targeted actions to improve the reporting of the effects of climate-related risks in the financial statements. The objective of this project is to determine whether and how financial statements could better communicate information about climate-related risks and extend to other uncertainties (eg due to changes in biodiversity) that coul arise in the future. At the date of the issue of this publication, the IASB published an Exposure Draft Climate-related and Other Uncertainties in the Financial Statements* that proposes eight examples illustrating how an entity applies IFRS Accounting Standards to report the effects of climate- related and other uncertainties in its financial statements. These examples aim to improve the reporting of the effects of climate-related and other uncertainties in the financial statements consistently with other information provided by an entity, without adding or changing requirements to the current IFRS Accounting Standards. They address three different areas: materiality judgements, disclosures about assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainties and disaggregation of information (applying new requirements developed in IFRS 18). These examples are supposed to be sufficiently generic to apply to different fact patterns in several industries, and"

Accordingly, \u00a9 encourage preparers of IFRS financial statements \u00bb carefully assess the relevance of assumptions and stimations used to prepare financial statements and formation provided elsewhere (eg on decarbonisation lans, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions) notably to 1Ifl requirements of the new ISSB Standards if they are pplicable to the entity, or equivalent standards such as 1e European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). xstly, we strongly suggest entities to consider :commendations of their local regulators when reparing their financial statements and assessing the ature and extent of information to disclose. The Example Financial Statements do not address any jurisdictional or regulatory requirements in areas such as management commentary, remuneration reporting or audi reporting. They also do not take into account any specific economic situations around the world. Most importantly, these Example Financial Statements sho not be used as a standalone disclosure checklist as facts o circumstances vary between entities an entity should asse! individually what information needs to be disclosed in its financial statements. IFRS Taxonomy The IFRS taxonomy reflects the presentation and disclosur requirements of the IFRS Standards issued by the IASB anc includes elements from the accompanying materials to the IFRS Accounting Standards such as implementation guidai and illustrative examples. In addition, it contains elements for disclosures not specifically required by IFRS Accountin, Standards but commonly reported in practice. The IFRS taxonomy is designed to improve communication between preparers and users of IFRS financial statements by enabli preparers to tag required disclosures making them easily accessible when viewing financial statements electronical The IASB usually publishes the annual IFRS taxonomy in th first quarter of each year, and 2024 was no different.

Particular attention should be given to .aking sure any disclosures placed outside the financial atements are not required by IFRS to be included within 1\u00a2 financial statements. Our view when drafting content for the annual report and the financial statements, is that preparers should question: + what is important to the business and what are its main objectives? + are these objectives consistent throughout the annual report? + is the right level of emphasis being placed on disclosure relating to events external to the entity? + are the messages about the impact of events external tc the entity consistent? + is the disclosure sufficient for the reader to be able to understand the impact of events external to the entity on the entity and assist them in making economic decisions? + are the financial statements using the same terminology between the financial statements, management commentary and any APMs that are being referred to? For example, if the statement of financial position is referred to as the balance sheet, is reference to the balance sheet made consistently throughout the report rather than switching between the two titles for the sam primary financial statement? + where the annual report includes APMs, have they all been properly reconciled to IFRS-based amounts included in the financial statements? + if any changes have been made to assumptions in light of events external to the entity since the entity last reported or if any new assumptions have been made, has a full explanation of these changes and their impac on the financial statements been disclosed?"

IAS 185 requires on entity to present such additional items (including the disaggregation of the line items listed in IAS 1.82) in the statements of profit or loss and oth comprehensive income when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity\u2019s financial performance. IAS 185A requires any additional subtotals presentec tobe: + comprised of line items made up of amounts, recognised and measured in accordance with IFR + presented and labelled in a manner that makes the line items that constitute the subtotal clear an understandable + consistent from period to period + no more prominent than the subtotals and totals required in IFRS for the statement(s) presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income. This statement of profit orloss presents an operating profit subtotal, which is commonly seen but is not required or defined in IFRS. Where this subtotal is provided, the figure disclosed should include items that would normally be considered to be operating.

However, an entity is permitted to.use other titles (eg \"balance sheet\u2019 instead of \u201cstatement of financial position\u2019) for the statements identified in WS 1 (AS 1.10) IAS 1.38A requires an entity to present, at a minimum, two statements of financial position, two statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, tw statements of cash flows, two statements of changes in equity, and related notes. These statements and related notes should be prepared for the current period and prior period In addition, IAS 110(f) and IAS 140A require an entity to present a third statement of financial position as \u00ab the beginning of the preceding period if: + itapplies an accounting policy retrospectively, makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements or reclassifis items in the financial statements, and + the retrospective application, retrospective restatement or the reclassification has a material effect on the information in the statement of financial position at the beginning of the preceding period. An entity can also elect to include additional comparative information (such as a third statement of financial position} as long as that information is, prepared in accordance with IFRS (IAS 138C). When the additional comparative information includes one or more of the statements identified in IAS 140, an entity must also present related note information. In contrast, IAS 140C states an entity that is required to present a third statement of financial position at t beginning of the preceding period does not need to present the related notes for that statement. The consolidated statement of financial position reflects the separate classification of current and non-eurrent assets and liabilities. When presentation based on liquidity is reliable and more relevant, the entity instead presents assets and liabilities in order of liquidity (IAS 1.60). Regardless of which method is, Used, the entity shall disclose the amount expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months for each asset and liability line item that combines \u2018amounts expected to be recovered or settled within and after more than 12 months (IAS 1.1)"

If the direct methoc \u2018was applied, an entity would disclose major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments. A statement of cashtlows is required to present cash flows from total operations, including cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations. These Example Financial Statements do not disaggregate cashflows into cashflows from continuing and discontinued operations on the face of the statement of cashflows. Instead, the net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations are disclosed in the notes, (Refer to note 20). An alternative would be to present the net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations on the face of the statement of cash flow: (FRS 5.33(@)"

If management concludes the entity may be liquidated (either by choice or because it has no realistic alternative but to do so) within 12 months from the end of the reporting period, the going concern assumption would not be appropriate and the financial statements may have to be prepared on another basis, such as a liquidation basis.

If there is material uncertainty about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, the entity should include going concern disclosure in the notes to its financial statements. Because the assessment regarding an entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern covers a period no less than 12 months from the annual reporting date, all events that occur during an entity\u2019s subsequent events period should be considered when evaluating whether there is significant doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. In other words, even if events during the subsequent events period are not considered adjusting subsequent events, they should still be incorporated into the going concern assessment. Furthermore, events or conditions that cast significant doubt on an entity's ability to continue as a going concern should be disclosed if there are material uncertainties or if a significant amount of judgement is involved in reaching the conclusion about whether the going concern assumption is appropriate. IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) agenda decisions from July 2010 and July 2014 should also be taken into consideration here. We recommend caution when considering the relevant period of assessment for going concern. There has been modification to the auditing standards at a local level in some jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand and the UK. They stipulate the auditor must ensure that management has considered a period of no less than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. The impact of the current environment of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty can be far reaching and difficult to predict, and as a result it is important to critically assess the potential impact on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They have been prepared under the assumption the Group operates on a going concern basis, which assumes the Group will be able to discharge its liabilities as they fall due. In confirming the validity of the going concern basis of preparation, the Group has considered the following specific factors: + the Group reported a profit of CU 14,858 for the year and had an excess of current assets over current liabilities of CU 62,279 + the Group generated positive operating cash flows of CU 26,620 in the current period + as disclosed in Note 34.3, liquidity needs of the Group are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as on the basis of a rolling 30-day projection. Long- term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day lookout period are identified monthly. Net cash requirements are compared to available borrowing facilities in order to determine headroom or any shortfalls. This analysis shows that available borrowing facilities are expected to be sufficient over the lookout periods, which is typically 12 months from the date of authorisation of these financial statements + management prepares an annual budget and longer-term strategic plan, including an assessment of cash flow requirements, and continue to monitor actual performance against budget and plan throughout the reporting period. Based on these factors, management has a reasonable expectation that the Group has and will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 (including comparatives) were approved and authorised for issue by the board of directors on 1 March 2025 (see Note 38).

For instance, where the entity operates in an industry that is particularly exposed to climate-related risk which creates an expectation that this may impact the ongoing activities of the entity, information about the reasons why management concluded that it has no effect in the short, medium or long-term on performance and financial position would be useful and relevant for the users.

Management continuously assesses the impact of climate-related matters. The Group's financial statements integrate climate-related matters in various items. Notably the Group's commitments to reduce carbon emissions were considered when performing impairment tests and assessing the useful life of its non-current assets (for more details on these specific impacts, please refer to Note 10 - Goodwill, Note 12 - Property, Plant and Equipment, and Note 33 - Contingent liabilities). The group also considered whether applying IAS 37 for its climate-related commitments would result in recognition of a liability (see Note 23 - Provisions). Assumptions could change in the future in response to forthcoming environmental regulations, new commitments taken and changing consumer demand. These changes, if not anticipated, could have an impact on the Group's future cash flows, financial performance and financial position. 4.4 Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. If the Group acquires a controlling interest in a business in which it previously held an equity interest, that equity interest is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date with any resulting gain or loss recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. Consideration transferred as part of a business combination does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. The gain or loss on the settlement of any pre-existing relationship is recognised in profit or loss. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. 4.5 Investments in associates and joint ventures Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures is increased or decreased to"

Foreign operations In the Group's financial statements, all assets, liabilities and transactions of Group entities with a functional currency other than the CU are translated into CU upon consolidation. The functional currencies of entities within the Group have remained unchanged during the reporting period. On consolidation, assets and liabilities have been translated into CU at the closing rate at the reporting date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity have been treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated into CU at the closing rate. Income and expenses have been translated into CU at the average rate\u00ae over the reporting period. Exchange differences are charged or credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the related cumulative translation differences recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss and are recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 4.7 Segment reporting Climate guidance: Climate-related matters may cause changes to the information reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), eg due to the potential impacts of new commitments that could lead to discontinuation of existing activities and/or significant investment in new ones. They could also impact the analysis performed to aggregate operating segments, eg due to changes in long-term gross profit margins that could differ significantly between operating segments. They may also significantly affect the business model of the entity by modifying the characteristics of its products and services and how they are distributed. That change in the business model may impact the operational segments the CODM is reviewing for financial internal purposes. The Group has three operating segments: consulting, service and retail. In identifying these operating segments, management generally follows the Group\u2019s service lines representing its main products and services {see Note 9)."

This primarily applies to the Group's headquarters and the Illustrative Research Lab in Greatville. 4.8 Revenue Climate guidance: Climate-related matters could lead to new disaggregation of revenue in an entity's financial communication (eg due to the information it is required to provide in its sustainability-related financial disclosures, or due to the development of new businesses, products, or services or the discontinuation of existing ones). Where appropriate, it could impact information provided in the financial statements when applying requirements of the standard on revenue disaggregation. +17(b) Guidance note: Revenue is one of the most important line items for most entities, and therefore a policy is almost always disclosed. Entities with multiple revenue streams should always remember to address each significant revenue stream separately.

Non-customised software is supplied under licences with a fixed term of between 1 and 3 years which convey a right to use software as it exists at the start of the licence period. The Group does not modify the software during the licence period. Bespoke solutions The Group also supplies customers with bespoke telecommunication solutions that include customised hardware and software and an installation service that enables the solution to interface with the customer's existing systems. The Group has determined that the hardware, software and installation service are each capable of being distinct as, in theory, the customer could benefit from them individually by acquiring the other elements elsewhere. However, the Group also provides a significant service of integrating these items to deliver a working solution such that, in the context of the actual contract, there is a single performance obligation to provide that solution. The Group has assessed that control of these solutions transfers to the customer over time. This is because each solution is unique to the customer (has no alternative use) and under local law the Group is entitled to a right to payment for the work completed to date in the event the customer sought to terminate the contract in the absence of an explicit right to terminate in the contract. Revenue for these performance obligations is recognised as the customisation or integration work is performed, using the cost-to-cost method to estimate progress towards completion. Costs incurred are considered to be proportionate to the entity's performance, so the cost-to-cost method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services to the customer. The cost of uninstalled materials is excluded from the calculation because the Group assesses that including these costs could overstate its progress towards delivering the solution. Billings on bespoke solutions contracts are based on attaining specified contract milestones. Contract assets will arise in situations where revenue is recognised in advance of the next progress billing. Customer loyalty programme The Group\u2019s retail division operates a customer loyalty incentive programme. For each CU 100 spent, customers obtain one loyalty point which they can redeem to receive discounts on future purchases. Loyalty points are considered to be a separate performance obligation as they provide customers with a material right they would not have received otherwise. Unused points expire if not"

Customers are required to pay in advance for each 12-month service period. Payments received in advance of performance obligations being satisfied are recognised as contract liabilities. + Maintenance contracts - these agreements provide customers with regularly scheduled maintenance on telecommunications hardware purchased from the Group. The contracts consist of a single performance obligation that is transferred over time [ie the contract period) because they involve a series of services that are substantially the same and the benefit of each service is received and consumed immediately. Revenue is recognised over time based on the ratio between the number of hours of maintenance services provided in the current period and the total number of such hours expected to be provided under each contract. This method best depicts the transfer of services to the customer because: (a) details of the services to be provided are specified by management in advance as part of its published maintenance program, and (b) the Group has a long history of providing these services to its customers, allowing it to make reliable estimates of the total number of hours involved in providing the service. + Extended warranty program - these agreements cover repairs and after-sales support for telecommunications hardware outside the Group's standard warranty period. This service involves an indeterminate number of acts as the Group is required to \u2018stand ready\u2019 to perform whenever a request falling within the scope of the program is made by a customer. The benefits of the Group standing ready are received and consumed immediately and the service has therefore been assessed as a single performance obligation that is transferred over time (ie the warranty period). Revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. This method best depicts the transfer of services to the customer as (a) the Group\u2019s historical experience demonstrates no statistically significant variation in the quantum of services provided in each year of a multi-year contract, and (b) no reliable prediction can be made as to if and when any individual customer will require service. Guidance note: The Group provides both standard-type warranties accounted for under IAS 37 and extended-type warranties treated as separate performance obligations under IFRS 15. When determining the nature of warranty-related promises, an entity considers: + whether the customer has the option to separately purchase the warranty + whether all or part of the warranty provides the customer with an additional service beyond the basic assurance that it will perform in accordance with published specifications. Additionally, an entity should assess extended warranties to see if they meet the scope exception in JERS 17 \u2018Insurance Contracts\u2019. The Group has determined that the transfer of"

Amounts remaining unbilled at the end of a reporting period are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as accounts receivable if only the passage of time is required before payment of these amounts will be due or as contract assets if payment is conditional on future performance. For the pointin-time contracts, materials and supplies are recognised as inventory and other directly attributable costs are initially recognised as contract fulfilment assets. These costs are expensed on delivery and acceptance (ie when the related revenue is recognised). The Group also provides IT outsourcing services including payroll and accounts payable trans- action processing to customers in exchange for a fixed monthly fee. These contracts involve a series of services that are substantially the same and the benefit of each service is received and consumed immediately. These contracts therefore consist of a single performance obligation for which control is transferred over time and revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of each contract. This method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services because the work required does not vary significantly from month-to-month. Construction of telecommunication systems The Group enters into contracts for the design, development and installation of telecommunication systems in exchange for a fixed fee. Due to the high degree of interdependence between the various elements of these projects, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. The Group recognises the related revenue over time because the systems are constructed at the customer sites and the customer controls the asset as it is constructed. When a contract also includes promises to perform after-sales services, these services represent a second performance obligation that is also satisfied over time (for the same reasons as the Group\u2019s maintenance contracts) but over a different period. The total transaction price is allocated between the two distinct performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling prices. To depict the Group's progress in satisfying these performance obligations, and to establish when and to what extent revenue can be recognised, the Group measures its progress by comparing actual hours spent to date with the total estimated hours required to design, develop, and install each system. The hours-to-hours basis provides the most faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services to each customer due to the Group's ability to make reliable estimates of the total number of hours required to perform, arising from its significant historical experience constructing similar sustems.

As the amortisation period of these costs, if capitalised, would be less than one year, the Group makes use of the practical expedient in IFRS 15 and expenses them as incurred. 4.9 Operating expenses Operating expenses are recognised in profit or loss upon utilisation of the service or as incurred. Expenditure for warranties is recognised when the Group incurs an obligation, which is typically when the related goods are sold. 4.10 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and reported in finance costs (see Note 27). 4.11 Profit or loss from discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale. A discontinued operation represents a separate major line of the business. Profit or loss from discontinued operations comprises the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal group(s) constituting the discontinued operation (see also Note 4.22 and Note 20). 4.12 Goodwill Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Refer to Note 4.16 for a description of impairment testing procedures. 4.13 Other intangible assets Climate guidance: Climate-related matters could result in new research and development activities to adapt the entity's business model to the risks identified. Entities should consider whether costs incurred satisfy the recognition criteria of IAS 38.57 for capitalisation. An example of useful information that can be disclosed is the amount of research and development (RED) costs incurred during the reporting period and the amount planned to be incurred in the next 12 months to satisfy the entity's transition plan as communicated in a report outside the financial statements."

Subsequent measurement All finite-lived intangible assets, including capitalised internally developed software, are accounted for using the cost model whereby capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date. In addition, they are subject to impairment testing as described in Note 4.16. The following useful lives are applied: + software: 3-5 years + brand names: 15-20 years + customer lists: 4-6 years. Any capitalised internally developed software that is not yet complete and intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised but are subject to impairment testing as described in Note 4.16. Amortisation has been included within depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets. Subsequent expenditures on the maintenance of computer software and brand names are expensed as incurred. When an intangible asset is disposed of, the gain or loss on disposal is determined as the difference between the proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognised in profit or loss within other income or other expenses. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 4.14 Property, plant and equipment Land Land owned is stated at revalued amounts. Revalued amounts are fair values based on appraisals prepared by external professional valuers once every two years, or more frequently if market factors indicate a material change in fair value (see Note 35.2).

Buildings, IT equipment and other equipment are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis to write down the cost less estimated residual value of buildings, IT equipment and other equipment. The following useful lives are applied: + buildings: 25-50 years + IT equipment: 2-5 years + other equipment: 3-12 years. In the case of right-of-use assets, expected useful lives are determined by reference to comparable owned assets or the lease term, if shorter. Material residual value estimates and estimates of useful life are updated as required, but at least annually. Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are recognised in profit or loss either within other income or other expenses. 4.15 Leased assets Climate guidance: Climate-related matters could impact lease contracts. For instance, if the underlying asset is highly polluting, entities may have to renegotiate the lease term and to remeasure the lease asset and the lease liability, In addition, any dismantling provision recognised with respect to removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, may also need to be reassessed to take into account new regulation requirements and or technologies.

The Group depreciates the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist. At the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate because as the lease contracts are negotiated with third parties it is not possible to determine the interest rate that is implicit in the lease. The incremental borrowing rate is the estimated rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the same amount over a similar term, and with similar security to obtain an asset of equivalent value. This rate is adjusted should the lessee entity have a different risk profile to that of the Group. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced by lease payments that are allocated between repayments of principal and finance costs. The finance cost is the amount that produces a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability. The lease liability is reassessed when there is a change in the lease payments. Changes in lease payments arising from a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase a leased asset. The revised lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment when the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. The exception being when the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero then any excess is recognised in profit or loss. Payments under leases can also change when there is either a change in the amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees or when future payments change through an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including changes in market rental rates following a market"

Climate-related matters may give rise to indications that an asset (or a group of assets) is impaired (eg due to programs to decarbonise production facilities and/or new regulations progressively restricting their use). Estimating value in use when determining the recoverable amount will require entities to assess whether climate-related issues have an impact on the business plans and financial and operational assumptions used (ie discount rate, long-term growth rate). Climate-related issues may also impact the methodology used to perform impairment tests (eg forecasting cash flow beyond business plans to consider effects of commitments taken by the company). The impact on impairment tests may come from the Group's climate-related commitments, expected changes in environmental regulations, future changes in customer demand, any adaptation of production models or process, any effect of the price increase of certain products or raw materials due to production processes being more environmentally friendly, the increase in insurance premiums due to the increased probability of natural disasters, etc. In measuring value-in-use, entities should base cash flow projections on reasonable and"

In May 2024, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 9 clarifying, among other things, how to assess the contractual cash-flow characteristics of financial assets with environmental, social and governance -linked features. The related amendments to IFRS 7 also require additional disclosures for such assets where material. Except for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs (where applicable).

If, as a result of climate-related changes, the entity experiences a significant increase in the allowance for expected credit losses, it may be necessary to provide information about the impact onthe measurement of ECL and on concentrations of credit risk. For instance, if the entity considers that climate-related risks have a material impact on its exposure to credit risk due to the number of clients or debtors affected by these risks relative to the entity\u2019s client portfolio, it will consider whether to provide additional information such as: Pa honihecaiic eiheveiteeniincerscratacl inthelncttatisedtannecstirele@ l(eciprs ace"

Classification and measurement of financial liabilities Climate guidance: An increasing number of entities issue \u2018green financing\u2019 in order to link funding with their climate strategy. For instance, this could be financing with funds dedicated to \u2018green\u2019 projects or borrowings, the remuneration of which may be indexed on ESG indicators which measure the borrower's performance in terms of sustainable development. The borrowings with interest payments linked to ESG criteria may raise accounting issues on the borrower's side (such as the existence of an embedded derivative and their separation analysis, the calculation of the effective interest rate or the subsequent accounting of changes in cash flows resulting from the difference between the entity's actual performance and its initial estimates at inception). In order to give a sufficient understanding of the financial consequences of sustainable financing, it is important to provide all the necessary information about the contractual characteristics and accounting treatment of these instruments. Amendments to IFRS 7 published in May 2024 require additional disclosure for contractual terms that could change the amount of contractual cash flows where material. These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026, with earlier application permitted. The Group\u2019s financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables and derivative financial instruments. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, and, where applicable, adjusted for transaction costs unless the Group designated a financial liability at FVTPL. Subsequently, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives and financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, which are carried subsequently at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss (other than derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedging instruments).

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at FVTPL except for derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships, which require a specific accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet all of the following requirements: + there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument + the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship, and + the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. For the reporting periods under review, the Group has designated certain forward currency contracts as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships. These arrangements have been entered into to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk arising from certain highly probable sales transactions denominated in foreign currency. All derivative financial instruments used for hedge accounting are recognised initially at fair value and reported subsequently at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position. To the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and included within the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognised immediately in profit or loss. At the time the hedged item affects profit or loss, any gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and presented as a reclassification adjustment within other comprehensive income. However, if a non-financial asset or liability is recognised as a result of the hedged transaction, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the hedged item.

For instance, if a subsidiary has a significant amount of unused tox losses; and operates in a jurisdiction whose government just enacted a new restrictive environmental regulation that negatively affects its business perspective's. In this situation and applying IAS 12.34-36, the entity should assess whether it should derecognise the deferred tax asset with respect to the unused tax losses, and to what extent (i.e. write down of the full or partial amount). Lastly, it is expected that the business plan used for the recognition of deferred tax assets is based con tthe same assumptions used when assessing the recoverable amount of non-current assets (see Note 4.16). Tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The calculation of current and deferred tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method. The carrying amounts of deferred tax are reviewed at the end of each reporting period on the basis of its most likely amount and adjusted if needed. Assessing the most likely amount of current and deferred tax in case of uncertainties (eg as a result of the need to interpret the requirements of the applicable tax law), requires the group to apply judgements in considering whether it is probable that the toxation authority will accept the tax treatment retained. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that the underlying tax loss or deductible temporary difference will be utilised against future taxable income. This is assessed based on the Group's forecast of future operating results, adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits on the use of any unused tax loss or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised in full, although IAS 12 specifies limited exemptions. Ae a result of these exemotions the Group does not recoanise deferred tax on temporaru differences:"

        "text": "Vuigeance not International Tax Reform: Pillar Two Model Rules In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED) published its Pillar Two Model GLoBE (or Global Anti-Base Erosion) Rules. The intent of the Pillar Two Model Rules is to ensure a minimum level of taxation will ultimately be paid by multinational entities who operate in very low or no tax jurisdictions. Currently more than 135 countries have signaled they will be modifying their tax local legislation, but they are at different stages of drafting legislation that aligns to the GLOBE Rules. At the date of this publication, some countries will have implemented legislation aligned to the framework; but many countries have still to do this. The GLOBE rules require individual countries to update their domestic tax laws to comply with the Pillar Two requirements to create a 15% minimum tax rate for multinational entities. This effect is achieved by requiring a \u2018top-up\u2019 tax. This means if a subsidiary of a multinational entity pays less than a 15% effective tax rate, the entity will trigger liability for the top-up tax at the ultimate parent entity level. The parent entity will then need to pay the additional tax required to bring the subsidiary'\u2019s effective tax rate up to the 15% minimum. As a result, ultimate parent companies with subsidiaries in jurisdictions with effective tax rates below 15% will have to pay additional income tax going forward. It is also important to note that when calculating local taxable income certain deductions may be disallowed when calculating GLOBE taxable income. This could result in a subsidiary triggering the top-up tax even if the local effective tax rate set out in legislation is 15% or above. The IASB amended IAS 12 \u2018Income Taxes\u2019 by issuing \u2018International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules\u2019, The IASB provided temporary mandatory relief from the recognition and measurement of all deferred tax associated with the GLOBE rules for annual periods ending on or before 31 December 2023. However, it did not exempt reporting entities from disclosing the impact of the GLOBE rules in annual financial statements issued on or after 31 December 2023. This means interim disclosures are expected in 2024 and beyond until the temporary mandatory relief expires. Interim disclosures regarding Pillar 2 \u2018top-up\u2019 tax will depend on the countries the group reporting entity operates in, their local effective tax rates, and whether those jurisdictions have fully implemented Pillar Two legislation. Illustrative Corporation Group is incorporated in Euroland, where the statutory tax rate is 30%, and it has subsidiaries in Euroland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As the US is not currently in the process of implementing any Pillar Two Tax legislation and the effective tax rate in the UK when taking into account"

Based on the information gathered, management has assessed that the Group is subject to a \u2018top-up\u2019 tax under the newly effective Pillar Two legislation for the interim period ended 30 June 2024. The top up tax relates to operations in [Name the country that has circumstances set out above in point 1] and [Name the country that has circumstances set out above in point 2].

In March 2024, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IC) published a decision (IFRS IC Update 03/2024) about the application of IAS 37 for climate-related commitments (such as commitments to reduce or offset greenhouse gas emissions). The IFRS IC concluded that: + Entities use judgement to assess whether a public statement of a net zero transition commitment gives an entity a constructive obligation to fulfil the commitment, considering all fact and circumstances surrounding the commitment taken (eg the language used in the statement, the specificity and status of plans supporting the statement, the timing of the actions required to fulfil the commitment, and publicly available evidence of progress to date). + Ifa constructive obligation exists, the entity applies the three recognition criteria of IAS 37 to assess whether a provision should be recognised. (The IC noted that an entity does not have a present obligation for costs of operating with lower emissions in the future. The obligation does not exist independently of the entity's future actions). Even if no provision is recognised, disclosures about judgments and estimations made to conclude whether a constructive obligation exists and the events that could create the obligation to record a liability and under which horizon (eg once emissions the entity is committed to compensate happens) might be provided to help users of financial statements understanding the effects of transition plans on financial statements. Provisions for product warranties, legal disputes, onerous contracts or other claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required from the Group and amounts can be estimated reliably. The timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. Restructuring provisions are recognised only if a detailed formal plan for the restructuring exists and management has either communicated the plan\u2019s main features to those affected or started implementation. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering ah nbecee nf nkRecetinme me cdl Den ET RT Tae nn ey"

The longer the term over which the events are expected to be resolved, the more the entity's expectation about these events are highly uncertain, and the more risk there is that assumptions might change. In this situation, beyond of a description of the nature of these uncertainties, the entity might provide sensitivity disclosures. Significant management judgements Guidance note: IAS 1 provides general guidance on disclosures about judgements made in applying accounting policy. Other Standards, such as IFRS 7, IFRS 12 \u2018Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities\u2019 and IFRS 15 supplement IAS 1 by requiring disclosure about particular judgements. The following are examples of disclosures for management judgements under IAS 1.122. An entity should disclose judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. These can be disclosed in either the accounting policies or the other notes to the financial statements. The following are the judgements made by management in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most significant effect on these consolidated financial statements. Recognition of contract revenue over time or at a point in time For some of the Group's contracts with customers significant judgement is required to assess whether control of the related performance obligation(s) transfers to the customer over time or at a point in time in accordance with IFRS 15. Specifically, for contracts that involve developing a customer- specific asset with no alternative use to the Group, judgement is needed to determine whether the Group is entitled to payment for its performance throughout the contract period if the customer sought to cancel the contract. This relates mainly to consulting contracts for design services which represent CU 110,810 (2023: CU 109,302) of the Group\u2019s revenue. In making this assessment the Group compares the amount it is entitled to collect based on the agreed payment schedule to the estimated level of costs at all stages in the contract in order to estimate the percentage margin it would retain on cancellation. The Group then compares the lowest margin percentage through the contract period to the expected margin percentage on completion.

Inventories Management estimates the net realisable values of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The future realisation of these inventories may be affected by future technology or other market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. Business combinations Management uses various valuation techniques when determining the fair values of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination (see Note 4.4). In particular, the fair value of contingent consideration is dependent on the outcome of many variables including the acquirees\u2019 future profitability (see Note 5.1). Construction contract revenue Recognised amounts of construction contract revenues and related receivables reflect management's best estimate of each contract\u2019s outcome and stage of completion. For more complex contracts in particular, costs to complete and contract profitability are subject to significant estimation uncertainty (see Note 4.8). Defined benefit obligation (DBO) Management's estimate of the DBO is based on a number of critical underlying assumptions such as standard rates of inflation, mortality, discount rate and anticipation of future salary increases. Variation in these assumptions may significantly impact the DBO amount and the annual defined benefit expenses amount (as analysed in Note 22.3). Fair value measurement Management uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of financial instruments (where active market quotes are not available) and non-financial assets. This involves developing estimates and assumptions consistent with how market participants would price the instrument. Management bases its assumptions on observable data as far as possible but this is not always available. In that case, management uses the best information available. Estimated fair values may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an arm's length transaction at the reporting date (see Note 35).

The growth rate for online retailing exceeds the overall long- term average growth rates for Euroland because this sector is expected to continue to grow at above-average rates for the foreseeable future. At this stage, and considering the direct exposure of the Group to the climate changes, management has considered growth rates were not significantly affected and were still consistent with long-term perspectives of its industry and expectations from market participants. Despite risks mentioned in Note 4.3, climate-related matters could nevertheless generate new business opportunities for the Group (eg acceleration of the Group's digital transformation presents a major opportunity for the Group to develop new consulting missions or accelerated technological progress together with the development of the circular economy. This could help the Group to gain a stronger foothold in the highly competitive market of retailing telecommunications hardware).

Retail segment The estimate of FVLCD for this segment is determined based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) multiples of comparable listed companies. Under the income approach, management's key assumptions include stable profit margins, based on past experience in this market. The Group's management believes this is the best available input for forecasting this mature market. Cash flow projections reflect stable profit margins achieved immediately before the most recent budget period. No expected efficiency improvements have been taken into account and prices and wages reflect publicly available forecasts of inflation for the industry. The recoverable amount of \u2018Retail Segment\u2019 was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. A 1% decrease in EBITDA would reduce the headroom in \u2018Retail Segment\u2019 by CU 562 in 2024 (2023: CU 463) but would not result in an impairment loss. Consulting segment The forecast was adjusted in 2023 for the decline in consulting services related to conventional telecommunication solutions. The market shifted considerably towards inter and intranet based solutions during 2023 and continued in 2024. As a result, management expects lower growth and moderately declining profit margins for this segment. Impairment testing, taking into account these latest developments, resulted in the further reduction of goodwill in 2024 to its recoverable amount. See Note 11 for the impairment of other intangible assets. The related goodwill impairment loss of CU 799 in 2024 (2023: CU 190) was included within depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non-financial assets. The estimate of recoverable amount for the consulting segment is particularly sensitive to the discount rate. If the discount rate used is increased by 1%, a further impairment loss of CU 300 would have to be recognised, of which CU 245 would be written off against goodwill and CU 55 against property, plant and equipment. A 1% decrease in forecasted EBITDA would result in additional impairment loss in \u2018Consulting Segment\u2019 by CU 238 in 2024 (2023: CU 196)."

The revalued amounts include a revaluation surplus of CU 1,288 before tax (2023: CU 985), which is not available for distribution to the shareholders of Illustrative Corporation. A review of the useful life for fixed assets has been performed in regard to climate change and environmental regulations as known at the reporting date and which has not identified any significant impact to the Group\u2019s carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment."

Investment properties are either leased to third parties on operating leases or are vacant. Rental income of CU 1,066 (2023: CU 1,028) is shown within revenue and includes CU 37 (2023: CU 344) from variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate. Direct operating expenses of CU 213 (2023: CU 206) are reported within other expenses, of which CU 18 (2023: CU 12) is incurred on vacant properties that did not generate rental income. Although the risks associated with rights the Group retains in underlying assets are not considered to be significant, the Group employs strategies to further minimise these risks. The unguaranteed residual values do not represent a significant risk for the Group, as they relate to property which is located in a location where market value, year on year, has always increased. For example, ensuring all contracts include clauses requiring the lessee to compensate the Group when a property has been subjected to excess wear-and-tear during the lease term. The lessee does not have an option to purchase the property at the expiry of the lease period. The lease contracts are all non-cancellable for eight years from the commencement of the lease.

        "text": "The critical terms of the foreign currency forwards entered into exactly match the terms of the hedged item. As such the economic relationship and hedge effectiveness are based on the qualitative factors and the use of a hypothetical derivative where appropriate. Hedge ineffectiveness may arise where the critical terms of the forecast transaction no longer meet those of the hedging instrument. For example if there was a change in the timing of the forecast sales transactions from what was initially estimated or if the volume of currency in the hedged item was below expectations leading to over-hedging. The hedged items and the hedging instrument are denominated in the same currency and as a result the hedging ratio is always one to one. All derivative financial instruments used for hedge accounting are recognised initially at fair value and reported subsequently at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position. To the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and included within the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship is recognised immediately in profit or loss. At the time the hedged item affects profit or loss, any gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and presented as a reclassification adjustment within other comprehensive income. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to profit or loss. If the hedging relationship ceases to meet the effectiveness conditions, hedge accounting is discontinued, and the related gain or loss is held in the equity reserve until the forecast transaction occurs. Other forward exchange contracts are considered by management to be part of economic hedge arrangements but have not been formally designated. During the year ended 31 December 2024 a gain of CU 890 (2023: CU 540) was recognised in other comprehensive income. During the year ended 31 December 20244 a gain of CU 640 (2023: CU 712) was reclassified from equity into profit or loss."

At the current time, no significant ineffectiveness has arisen from credit risk or from over-hedging although this is monitored on an ongoing basis. 15.5 Borrowings Guidance note: Non-current debts with covenants Amendments to IAS 1 apply for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. New disclosure requirements have been added for loan arrangements classified as non-current, when the entity's right to defer settlement is subject to the entity complying with covenants within twelve months after the reporting period. In such situations, the entity shall disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that the liabilities could become repayable within twelve months after the reporting period, specifically: + Information about the covenant (the nature, and when the entity is required to comply with it); + Carrying amount of related liabilities; and, + Facts and circumstances that may indicate that the entity could have difficulties complying with covenants (if any). For instance, the entity may consider whether it has acted during or after the reporting period to avoid or mitigate a potential breach, or whether it would not have complied with the covenants if they were to be assessed for compliance based on the entity's circumstances at the end of the reporting period. Borrowings include the following financial liabilities: Current Non-current 31Dec 31Dec 31Dec 31Dec 2024 2023 2024 2023 At amortised cost: US-dollar loans 250 255 7770 7965 Other bank borrowings 4,565 3,124 - - Non-convertible bond - - 8,300 8,300 Subordinated shareholder loan - - 5,000 5,000"

As the waiver was obtained before the reporting date, the Group has considered that it had no obligation to reclassify the non-current part of the loan as current at the reporting date. The US-dollar loan is also subject to a \u201cnet financial cost to EBITDA ratio\u201d covenant at the end of each annual and half-year reporting period. This ratio must not exceed 7%. At the end of the 2024 reporting period, the group was in compliance with this covenant as this ratio was computed to be 6%. The group expects to comply with this covenant at the June reporting date. The other bank borrowing and bond contracts are not subject to covenants. Other bank borrowings are secured by land and buildings owned by the Group (see Note 12). Current interest rates are variable and average 4.0 % (2023: 4.1%). The carrying amount of the other bank borrowings is considered to be a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The Group's non-convertible bond with a fixed interest rate of 5.0% matures on 1% May 2027 and is therefore classified as non-current. The estimated fair value of the non-convertible bond is categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value estimate has been determined from the perspective of a market participant that holds these non-convertible bonds as assets at 31 December 2024. The fair value CU 8,259 is estimated using a present value technique, by discounting the contractual cash flows using implied yields of non-convertible bonds of an entity with a similar standing and marketability. The most significant input being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of issuer entity. The subordinated shareholder loan was provided by Illustrative Corporation Ltd\u2019s main shareholder, SRC Investment Trust, in 2020. It is perpetual and carries a fixed coupon of 4.0%. It is repayable only upon liquidation of Illustrative Corporation Ltd. The estimated fair value of the subordinated shareholder loan is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, The fair value estimate has been determined using a present value technique. The amount of CU 4,975 (2023: CU 5,050) is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows at 4.1% (2023: 4.3%). The discount rate has been determined using the interest rate that the entity would pay to unrelated party, at the reporting date, adjusted to reflect the subordination feature. The most significant input in both reporting periods is the discount rate of 4.1%."

Revenue and expenses, gains and losses relating to the discontinuation of this subgroup have been eliminated from profit or loss from the Group's continuing operations and are shown as a single line item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Both programmes will be settled in equity. The Star Programme is part of the remuneration package of the Group's senior management. Options under this programme will vest if certain conditions, as defined in the programme, are met. It is based on the performance of the Illustrative Corporation's shares compared to other companies in the Greatstocks Stock Exchange within a specified period, In addition, participants in this programme have to be employed until the end of the agreed vesting period. Upon vesting, each option allows the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a discount of 20-25% of the market price determined at grant date. The Stay Programme is part of the remuneration package of the Group's research and development and sales personnel. Options under this programme will vest if the participant remains employed for the agreed vesting period. The maximum term of the options granted under the Stay Programme (ie the vesting period) ends on 31 January 2025. Upon vesting, each option allows the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a discount of 15-20% of the market price determined at grant date. Share options and weighted average exercise prices are as follows for the reporting periods presented: Star Programme Stay Programme Number of Weighted Number of Weighted shares average shares average exercise price exercise price per share per share Outstanding at 31 December 2023 300,000 624 95,250 581 Granted - - - - Forfeited (513) 6.24 (1.012) 5.81 Exercised - - - -"

According to the plan, a certain percentage of the current salary is converted into a pension component each year until retirement. Pensions under this scheme are paid out when a beneficiary has reached the age of 65. The pensionable salary is limited to CU 100 for a year. Eligible employees are required to contribute a stated percentage of pensionable salary. In Euroland and the UK, the pension payments are linked to the consumer price index (CPI), although certain limitations apply. The plan assets are managed by a pension fund that is legally separated from the Group. The board of trustees of the pension fund is required by its articles of association to act in the best interest of the fund and it is responsible for setting the investment policies. The Group has no representation on the board of the fund. The plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as interest rate risk, investment risk, longevity risk and inflation risk: + Interest rate risk - The present value of the defined benefit liability is caloulated using a discount rate determined by reference to market yields of high-quality corporate bonds. The estimated term of the bonds is consistent with the estimated term of the DBO and it is denominated in CU. A decrease in market yield on high quality corporate bonds will increase the Group's defined benefit liability, although it is expected that this would be offset partially by an increase in the fair value of certain of the plan assets. + Investment risk - The plan assets at 31 December 2024 are predominantly real estate, equity and debt instruments. The fair value of the plan assets is exposed to the real estate market (in Euroland and the US). The equity instruments are significantly weighted towards the finance and pharmaceuticals sectors in Euroland. + Longevity risk - The Group is required to provide benefits for life for the members of the defined benefit liability. Increase in the life expectancy of the members, particularly in Euroland and in the UK where the pension payments are linked to CPI, will increase the defined benefit liability, + Inflation risk \u2014 A significant proportion of the defined benefit liability is linked to inflation. An increase in the inflation rate will increase the Group's liability. A portion of the plan assets are inflation-linked debt securities which will mitigate some of the effects of inflation. Employees of the Group are required to contribute a fixed 5% of the pensionable salary. The"

Provisions classified as held for sale are included within amount utilised (see Note 20). The provision for restructuring relates to the Phoenix programme, which was initiated in late 2021 and carried out predominantly in 2023 and 2024. The restructuring provision as at 31 December 2024 was reduced following the outcome of several lawsuits brought against the Group during 2024 by former employees. Out of court settlements based on the outcome of earlier settlements are expected for most of the remaining claims. The Group\u2019s management expects to settle the remaining termination remuneration for former employees and legal fees relating to the restructuring programme in 2025. The Group is not eligible for any reimbursement by third parties in this regard. Other provisions relate to various legal and other claims by customers, such as warranties for which customers are covered for the cost of repairs. Usually, these claims are settled between 3 and 18 months from initiation, depending on the procedures used for negotiating the claims. As the timing of settlement of these claims is to a large extent dependent on the pace of negotiation with various counterparties and legal authorities, the Group cannot reliably estimate the amounts that will eventually be paid in settlement after more than 12 months from the reporting date. Therefore, the amount is classified as current. The majority of the other provisions recognised at 31 December 2023 related to claims initiated in 2023 that were settled during 2024, Management, on the advice of counsel, does not expect that the outcome of any of the remaining cases will give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts recoanised at 31 December 2024. None of the provisions will be discussed here in further detail so"

Financial instruments risk Risk management objectives and policies The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Group's financial assets and liabilities by category are summarised in Note 15.1. The main types of risks are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close cooperation with the board of directors, and focuses on actively securing the Group's short to medium-term cash flows by minimising the exposure to volatile financial markets. Long-term financial investments are managed to generate lasting returns. The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes nor does it write options. The most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below. The Group enters into derivatives, principally for hedging foreign exchange risk. Associated disclosures relating to hedge accounting are included in Note 15.4. Guidance note: IFRS 9 amended IFRS 7 to allow disclosures of financial instruments risks arising from the entity's hedge accounting activities and associated risk managing strategies to be placed outside the financial statements. Although paragraph IFRS 7.21B requires an entity to present the required disclosures in a single note or separate section in its financial statements, an entity need not duplicate information that is already presented elsewhere, provided that the information is incorporated by cross-reference from the financial statements to some other statement.

To mitigate the Group\u2019s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-CU cash flows are monitored and forward exchange contracts are entered into in accordance with the Group\u2019s risk management policies. Generally, the Group's risk management procedures distinguish short-term foreign currency cash flows (due within six months) from longer-term cash flows (due after six months). Where the amounts to be paid and received in a specific currency are expected to largely offset one another, no further hedging activity is undertaken. Forward exchange contracts are mainly entered into for significant long-term foreign currency exposures that are not expected to be offset by other same-curreny transactions.

Equity is more sensitive in 2024 than in 2023 because of an increase in use of foreign currency forwards. Interest rate sensitivity The Group\u2019s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. Longer-term borrowings are therefore usually at fixed rates. At 31 December 2024, the Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates through bank borrowings at variable interest rates. Other borrowings are at fixed interest rates. The Group's investments in bonds and debentures all pay fixed interest rates. The exposure to interest rates for the Group\u2019s money market funds is considered immaterial. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/- 1% (2023: +/- 1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.

For the listed equity securities, an average volatility of 20% has been observed during 2024 (2023: 18%). This volatility figure is considered to be a suitable basis for estimating how profit or loss and equity would have been affected by changes in market risk that were reasonably possible rn Te Tere"

In addition, the Group does not hold any collateral relating to other financial assets (eg derivative assets, cash and cash equivalents held with banks) at each annual reporting date. Trade receivables and contract assets The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified model of recognising lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables as these items do not have a significant financing component. In measuring the expected credit losses, the trade receivables have been assessed on a collective basis as they possess shared credit risk characteristics. They have been grouped based on the days past due and also according to the geographical location of customers. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profile for sales over the past 48 months before 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023 respectively as well as the corresponding historical credit losses during that period. The historical rates are adjusted to reflect current and forwarding looking macroeconomic factors affecting the customer's ability to settle the amount outstanding. The Group has identified gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment rates of the countries in which the customers are domiciled to be the most relevant factors and according adjusts Ltetarinal Ince ratae far avnantad ehanaee in thace factare Laweavar aivan the ehart narind avanead"

The Group's objective is to maintain cash and marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements for 30-day periods at a minimum. This objective was met for the reporting period.

Measurement of fair value of financial instruments The Group's finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values, in consultation with third party valuation specialists for complex valuations. Valuation techniques are selected based on the characteristics of each instrument, with the overall objective of maximising the use of market-based information. The finance team reports directly to the chief financial officer (CFO) and to the audit committee. Valuation processes and fair value changes are discussed among the audit committee and the valuation team at least every year, in line with the Group's annual reporting dates. The following valuation techniques are used for instruments categorised in Levels 2 and 3: + Foreign currency forward contracts (Level 2) - The Group's foreign currency forward contracts are not traded in active markets. These contracts have been fair valued using observable forward exchange rates and interest rates corresponding to the maturity of the contract. The effects of non-observable inputs are not significant for foreign currency forward contracts. + Contingent consideration (Level 3) - The fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Goodtech (see Note 5.1) is estimated using a present value technique. The CU 620 fair value is estimated by probability-weighting the estimated future cash outflows, adjusting for risk and discounting at 7.4%. The probability-weighted cash outflows before discounting are CU 655 and reflect management's estimate of a 50% probability that the contract's target level will be achieved. The discount rate used is 7.4%, based on the Group\u2019s estimated incremental borrowing rate for unsecured liabilities at the reporting date, and therefore reflects the Group's credit position. The effects on the fair value of risk and uncertainty in the future cash flows are dealt with by adjusting the estimated cash flows rather than adjusting the discount rate. * Investment in XY Ltd (Level 3) - The fair value of this investment was determined based on an appropriate equity pricing model that takes into account the investee\u2019s dividends policy and its historical and expected future performance and based on an appropriate growth factor for a similar listed entity and a risk adjusted discount rate."

The significant inputs and assumptions are developed in close consultation with management. The valuation processes and fair value changes are reviewed by the board of directors and audit committee at each reporting date. Land owned in Euroland (Level 3) The appraisal was carried out using a market approach that reflects observed prices for recent market transactions for similar properties and incorporates adjustments for factors specific to the land in question, including plot size, location, encumbrances and current use. In 2024, a negative adjustment of 7.5% was incorporated for these factors. The land was revalued on 23 November 2024. The land was previously revalued in November 2021. The significant unobservable input is the adjustment for factors specific to the land in question. The extent and direction of this adjustment depends on the number and characteristics of the observable market transactions in similar properties that are used as the starting point for valuation. Although this input is a subjective judgement, management considers that the overall valuation would not be materially affected by reasonably possible alternative assumptions. Land with a fair value of CU 730, recognised upon the acquisition of Goodtech in March 2024 (see Note 5.1), was not revalued at the reporting date. Management determined that the effect of changes in fair values between the acquisition and reporting date is immaterial.

This depends on management's assessment of which format provides information that is reliable and more relevant. The NOE format is illustrated in the main body of the Example Financial Statements. The FOE format is illustrated in this appendix. This appendix presents a separate statement of profit or loss, ie other comprehensive income is presented in a separate statement of comprehensive income (see the main body of the Example Financial Statements). If the entity presents a single statement of comprehensive income (see Appendix B), the FOE format included in this appendix may replace the NOE format presented in in Appendix B. The FOE or NOE formats only affect the statement of profit or loss but do not affect the presentation requirements for other comprehensive income. Presenting the statement of profit or loss in the FOE format requires additional considerations: + additional disclosures of the nature of certain expenses are required. These disclosures should include employee benefit expenses and depreciation, amortisation and impairment of non- financial assets, however disclosure of other NOE categories may also be required if material + the disclosures of the specific line items in the statement of profit or loss where certain transactions or amounts are recognised (eg, see Note 9, Note 10 and Note 22 of the Example Financial Statements) should reflect the actual line items presented in the FOE statement of profit or loss. In addition, when an entity includes the analysis of profit or loss from a discontinued operation in the notes to the financial statements (see Note 20), such information should be presented in the same format as the main consolidated statement of profit or loss. This will facilitate a better understanding of the financial effects of the discontinued operations. If a FOE format is used, all expenses must be included in the relevant FOE categories, with the avaantinn afimanirmant pharaae in ralatian ta finanaial qecate and rant rant qeeate whinh met ha"
